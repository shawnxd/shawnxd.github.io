I started to be education advisor when I was a junior student in Beijing, and volunteered to teach in Kenya as a computer science teacher before. I taught <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/208044401_479688">AMC12</a> in <a href="http://www.xdf.cn/">XDF.CN</a> since 2017.
I possess an unwavering passion for aiding students and engineers in their career paths. I find it deeply fulfilling to provide guidance and support to those who are just starting out in their professional journey or seeking to advance their skills and knowledge.
Furthermore, I am always willing to collaborate and communicate with my fellow engineers, as I believe that sharing ideas and expertise can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.
